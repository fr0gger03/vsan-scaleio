#2016 Dell | EMC SDS Training Schedule

##High level objectives
1. Required result - we are trying to get the SE population moving towards a place where they can successfully and confidently present, size, and sell software defined storage solutions.
2. Required result – to begin to resolve the ambiguities and friction of VSAN versus ScaleIO sales
3. Required Result – clearly identify use cases / customer problems for each technology, when and how to position the correct solution.
4. Required result – to continue education around competitive offerings and how to defeat them in the field.
5. Desired Result – understand how Dell fits into this…  we should be including a section on Ready Nodes.
6. Desired Result - understand delivery / implementation options
  1. BYO with any vendor
  2. Ready Nodes – what are they, where to find them?
  3. VMware Ready Nodes –
    1. What is a Server Profile?
    2. Identify and Define performance and capacity metrics used for profiles
    3. What are the different server profiles?
    4. Ready Nodes with Dell
  4. HCI Appliance
    1. VxRAIL
    2. VxRACK?


* The training is suggested to last 1 day (at this point ☺)
* We should include cross-Federation and cross-functional groups (VCE, VMware, EMC, DPS, etc) wherever possible.
* Let the SMEs in each area cover their subject (VMware talk about VMware sizing, EMC talks about storage, etc) – BUT all groups need to be present and provide support.  
* We need to have this done and locked down by about the middle of March (at the latest) so Dan has time to lock down resources, locations, and calendars.
* The session will be led by a team of EMC, VMware, and VCE SEs with SMEs brought in as needed.  In other words – there will be one deck and multiple presenters that will take turns and interweave their messages.  ONE TEAM – ONE FEDERATION!

##Needed items from Leadership
* A presenter from each manufacturer that is qualified to present the materials herein.  There should be a representative from EMC, VCE, and VMware
* Any other specialists that are needed for the material listed below
* Presentation materials, demos, or whiteboards for each section
* The manufacturers should choose one individual to be the overall spokesman and MC to keep things on track
* A facility large enough to seat everyone comfortably
* A whiteboard and a projector
* Food – lunch will be provided
* A mic for the presenters if necessary
* Shared (SyncP or fileserver) scenario for the take home exercise
* A functioning clock and the will to use it.  The timing is critical to maintain – we will need to be brutal with time.

##Pre-Event Homework
* vSAN HOL - 2 hours for the vSAN hands-on lab

##Overall Daily Schedule

###Day 1 - 8am to 6pm
A quick note
* It has been pointed out several times that there is a dearth of breaks and a scarcity of lunch time.  This is an unfortunate side effect of needing to get 2 tons of face melting awesomesauce into a bag about the size of a Pez dispenser.  We have cut this schedule down several times and we still feel that we could use more time for discussion – and we’re already slave drivers running from 8am to 6pm.  Please be understanding if someone needs to step out several times through the day for a few minutes to clear their head ☺
* In seats and ready to roll by 8am.  Anyone late on any day has to stand in front of the room and sing the National Anthem.  Music will be provided.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD1heornT7Y
