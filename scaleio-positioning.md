Consider the attached PDF…  They clearly want to position ScaleIO as an x86, scale-out, commodity-based, SAN replacement.  That includes:
 
Distributed pool of storage capacity (GB) and performance (IOps, GBps) and consistent IOPS/latency – no hotspots, no matter the load
Dynamic storage pooling – share or move storage pool dynamically between hosts, cluster and even across different host/cluster type
Scale storage pool independently (GB, IOps, GBps) completely independently of compute
Scales bigger than traditional SAN – an order of magnitude bigger than the biggest external SANs in every dimension (GB, IOps, GBps)
Scales easily and non-disruptively compared to traditional SAN– small increments, pay as you grow and never do a data migration again
 
This is fundamentally different than the messaging platform for every other Hyperconverged solution:
Hyperconvergence Makes IT Easier by collapsing both the compute and storage
Hyperconvergence Makes IT Easier by greatly reducing the required administration of the storage layer.  This allows you to:  
Deploy infrastructure to support business initiatives more quickly.
Reduce ongoing costs associated with managing your virtual infrastructure
Eliminate daily tasks that burden your operational staff
Reduce capital needed for technology refreshes and new infrastructure projects.
 
That is to say, the messaging around Hyperconvergence is all about:
Tight integration between storage and compute layers
Greatly reduced administration of storage through the use of policy…
 
Spending 5 minutes with the ScaleIO Installation guide is enough to let you know that there is no way most vSphere teams are going to sign up for it… It is all Python scripting, requires a separate management domain, and is not tightly integrated with vSphere.
