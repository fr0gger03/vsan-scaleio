* The training is suggested to last 1 day (at this point ☺)
* We should include cross-Federation and cross-functional groups (VCE, VMware, EMC, DPS, etc) wherever possible.
* Let the SMEs in each area cover their subject (VMware talk about VMware sizing, EMC talks about storage, etc) – BUT all groups need to be present and provide support.  
* We need to have this done and locked down by about the middle of March (at the latest) so Dan has time to lock down resources, locations, and calendars.
* The entire 3 day session will be led by a team of EMC, VMware, and VCE SEs with SMEs brought in as needed.  In other words – there will be one deck and three presenters that will take turns and interweave their messages.  ONE TEAM – ONE FEDERATION!

##Needed items from Leadership 
* A presenter from each manufacturer that is qualified to present the materials herein.  There should be a representative from EMC, VCE, and VMware
* Any other specialists that are needed for the material listed below
* Presentation materials, demos, or whiteboards for each section
* The manufacturers should choose one individual to be the overall spokesman and MC to keep things on track
* A facility large enough to seat everyone comfortably
* A whiteboard and a projector
* Food – lunch will be provided 
* A mic for the presenters if necessary
* Shared (SyncP or fileserver) scenario for the take home exercise
* A functioning clock and the will to use it.  The timing is critical to maintain – we will need to be brutal with time.

##Pre-Event Homework

##Overall Daily Schedule

###Day 1 - 8am to 6pm
A quick note
* It has been pointed out several times that there is a dearth of breaks and a scarcity of lunch time.  This is an unfortunate side effect of needing to get 2 tons of face melting awesomesauce into a bag about the size of a Pez dispenser.  We have cut this schedule down several times and we still feel that we could use more time for discussion – and we’re already slave drivers running from 8am to 6pm.  Please be understanding if someone needs to step out several times through the day for a few minutes to clear their head ☺
* In seats and ready to roll by 8am.  Anyone late on any day has to stand in front of the room and sing the National Anthem.  Music will be provided.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD1heornT7Y
